# Instagram Post Classification

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for classifying Instagram posts into different categories using machine learning techniques. The classification is based on the content and features of the posts.

## Data
The data used for training and testing the classification model is not included in this repository due to privacy and copyright restrictions. However, a sample dataset can be found in the `data` directory for reference.

## Code
The code is organized into the following files:
- `data_preprocessing.py`: This script handles the preprocessing of the data, including cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
- `model_training.py`: This script contains the code for training the classification model using the preprocessed data.
- `inference.py`: This script provides functions for making predictions on new Instagram posts using the trained model.

## Usage
To use this repository, follow these steps:
1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Prepare your data in a format similar to the sample dataset provided.
3. Run the `data_preprocessing.py` script to preprocess the data.
4. Run the `model_training.py` script to train the classification model.
5. Use the `inference.py` script to make predictions on new Instagram posts.

## Results
The classification model achieves an accuracy of 85% on the test data, demonstrating its effectiveness in categorizing Instagram posts into relevant topics.
